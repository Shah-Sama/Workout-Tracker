# MYTRACK FITNESS APP

## A way to track your customized workouts

A brief explanation of MYTRACK:
- **What will the application do?**

The goal of the application is to be a way for people to store their own customized workouts to a program and then 
later recover them. The application is called *MYTRACK FITNESS* and allows the user to create new workouts for 
different muscle groups e.g chest,arms,legs by inputting the type of exercise the user wants to add along with how many
sets and reps they want to do it for. I will store the values in classes to be saved and multiple               
groups of exercises will combine into a list of them to make a whole workout. 
I will add a functionality to allow them to add, delete and save their workouts so that when they log back on they can
retrieve their stored workouts and continue to edit them or simply view them. Additional features can be added to the 
project such as a set pre-given list of exercises with brief descriptions on how they work and what part of the muscle 
they focus on. I also wanted to add a recommended exercise feature where if the user doesn't know what exercise they 
want to do, they can click a button that shows them some workouts with a description of what they do
- **Who will use it?**

This application can be used by anyone who wants to track a physical activity they enjoy. I plan to implement sports 
to be added as well so that it doesn't just involve exercises at the gym. So this application is for anyone (all ages)
who wants to keep a record of their physical exercises they do.
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

During high school, I found myself overworking and being 
overwhelmed with all the work. I found the gym as a sort of therapy where I could go and all the outside 
stress of exams, clubs, work and personal life problems would go away. 
Although I haven't always been consistent, going to the gym helped me lose weight and live an overall happier life.
I think creating an app to help people have an easier time keeping track of what exercises they do can be 
beneficial as there are so many types of workouts.

Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time I would focus on refactoring for optimization for the complier and code cleanup. This would involve
removing redundant for loops or statements that are repeating in order to decrease runtime and increase the efficiency.
Additionally, my refactoring could involve cleaning up the codebase by removing any unused or redundant code, improving 
variable and function naming conventions, and adhering to coding best practices. This would make the codebase more 
readable and maintainable, reducing the chances of introducing bugs or making mistakes in the future. As well as making
debugging easier and makes it simpler for other programmers to edit as they will understand it more. I would change the 
function name to things more relevant. I would use the principles talked about in 210 particularly the design module to
refactor and optimize the code.
